# 2dgameengine
Simple 2D game engine using sdl, imgui and sol for lua binding

This project was started for learning purpose, I try to improve it in my spare time. It still lacks a lot of things such as the Lua binding to be able to script. The engine will probably be rebuilt from scratch in a more robust way, using an ECS worthy of the name, such as the famous "entt" for example.
