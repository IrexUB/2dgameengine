# 2D Game Engine
Simple 2D game engine using sdl, glm, imgui and sol for lua binding

This project was started for learning purpose, I try to improve it in my spare time. It still lacks a lot of things like the Lua binding to be able to script. The engine will probably be rebuilt from scratch using more robust tools than what I programmed, this one will probably be based on an ECS (Entity Component System) worthy of the name, like the famous "entt" for example.

## Main Todo:
- Scene management through Lua Binding which has not yet been implemented in order to refactor the Setup() method of the Game class
